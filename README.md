# reactiontest
The Reaction Test Game is a hardware-based project designed to measure a user’s reaction time. The system activates an LED after a random delay, and the user must press a push button as quickly as possible. The response time is then measured and evaluated.
Features

Random LED signal generation

User input through push button

Reaction time measurement using timing logic

Simple and interactive gameplay

Circuit simulation using Tinkercad

Components Used

Arduino UNO

LEDs

Push Button

Resistors

Buzzer

Breadboard & Connecting Wires

Working Principle

The system waits for a random delay.

An LED turns ON to signal the user.

The user presses the button as fast as possible.

The time difference between LED activation and button press is calculated as reaction time.

Feedback is provided through LED/Buzzer output.
