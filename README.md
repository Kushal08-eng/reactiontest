REACTION TEST GAME

Overview
This project is a Reaction Test Game designed to measure a user’s reaction time. The system turns on an LED after a random delay, and the user must press a push button as quickly as possible. The time difference between the signal and the response is calculated as the reaction time.

Features

Generates a random delay before the LED turns ON

Detects user input through a push button

Measures reaction time using timing logic

Simple and interactive hardware-based game

Circuit designed and tested using Tinkercad

Components Used

Arduino UNO

LEDs

Push button

Resistors

Buzzer

Breadboard and connecting wires

Working Principle

The system waits for a random delay.

An LED turns ON to signal the user.

The user presses the button as fast as possible.

The reaction time is calculated based on the delay between LED activation and button press.

Feedback is provided using an LED or buzzer.
