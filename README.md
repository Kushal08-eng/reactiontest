# reactiontest
The Reaction Test Game is a hardware-based project designed to measure a user’s reaction time. The system activates an LED after a random delay, prompting the user to press a push button as quickly as possible. The reaction time is calculated from the delay between the LED signal and the user response. The project demonstrates digital I/O interfacing, timing logic, and basic event-driven control. The circuit was designed and tested using Tinkercad, providing hands-on experience in embedded systems and hardware implementation.
